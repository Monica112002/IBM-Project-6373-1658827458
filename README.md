Intelligent Vehicle Damage Assessment &amp; Cost Estimator for Insurance Companies


The motor insurance sector loses a lot of money as a result of leakage claims. The gap between the amount actually paid for claims and the amount that would have been paid had all of the best practises in the industry been followed is known as underwriting leakage. These results have been reached using both testing and visual assessment. However, they do delay the processing of claims. By reducing loss adjustment costs, improvements in the First Notice of Loss and the speed with which claims are examined and evaluated might save a lot of money in the automobile insurance claims process. Car damage is automatically identified and classified using advanced picture analysis and pattern recognition technology, a method for automatically locating the damaged area by comparing photos of the automobile from before and after an accident. This project's proposed a CNN model that can recognise a car's damage area. If users upload images, the model can evaluate damage (be it a dent or scratch from an object), and it can also estimate the extent of damage. Insurance firms can handle claims more efficiently as a result. When accepting a car loan, particularly one for a used vehicle, lenders may also consider this model.
